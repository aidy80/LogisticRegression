This program is broken into three sections: logReg.py which contains the
logistic regression classifier itself, analyzeData.py where the mnist and
titanic datasets are parsed and seperated into training and testing sets. In
analyzeData.py the logistic regression is also analyzed using the datasets
for its accuracy, best hyperparameters, and training time. Finally, main.py
runs the tests created in analyzeData.py on the mnist and titanic datasets and
pickles the classifier on both the titanic and mnist datasets. 

To run these tests, simply run
    python main.py
This will find the accuracy of several lambda values on both datasets and
output them to the files mnistTestAcc.dat, mnistTrainAcc.dat, titTestAcc.dat,
and titTrainAcc.dat. It will also time the stochastic and normal gradient
descent algorithms and output points about the loss function and time into the
files normStep.txt, normTime.txt, sgdStep.txt, sgdTime.txt. Finally, cross
validation will be run on the two datasets with the best found lambdas to test
the accuracies and output the results to the files titAcc.dat and mnistAcc.dat.

Warning: These processes will take a while (roughly 10 minutes for the large
processes) due to a small step size. To increase the speed of the convergence, 
you can decrease the value of epsilon in the logReg files for both classifiers. 
Do not, however, decrease the step size, this must be small for the 
algorithm to work correctly.
